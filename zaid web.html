<h2 align="center">So what is HTML?
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</h2>

<h2 align="left"><u>The main parts of our element are as follows:

<p>1:The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</p>

<p>2:The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</p>

<P>3:The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</p>

<p>4:The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</P></u></h2>
<h1 align="center">Void elements</h1>
<h2 align="left"><p>Some elements have no content and are called void elements. Take the <img> element that we already have in our HTML page:</p>

<p>img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" </p>

<p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing </img> tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.</p></h2>
